Welcome to FORGE Service Lab wiki
=============================================================================

FORGE Service Lab
is an environment which can be used to develop digital services in
collaboration with others.

FORGE supports the learning journey in designing, developing and
piloting digital services by enabling co-working and giving support with
help of world-class tools.

The future of a service is like a game, and a service game platform is a
cloud computing environment, and the whole Internet. FORGE Service Lab
is a Finnish service creation platform, of which starting point is the
Finnish service business and its' needs. It enables the development of
internationally competitive services for Internet economy in Finland.
Digital services design and development chain means all of the methods
and tools needed for the creation of digital services, from concept to
large scale implementation. FORGE utilizes service design methods and
cloud computing.

FORGE's cloud service platform is an R & D & I environment (not for
commercial activities) and in common use, so you do not need to build
your own platform in order to play with your service while it is still
evolving. It is possible to implement your own ideas quickly. In
addition, you can opt-in solutions build by the community and combine
them with your own service capabilities, which are perhaps not yet
commercially available.
